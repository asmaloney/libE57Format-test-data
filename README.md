# libE57Format Test Data

This repository contains test files for libE57Format.

Because the number of files and size of the data can grow quickly, the test data is kept here instead of in the main repository. If ends up being too big for a git repo we might have to switch and make it available as a zip download somewhere.

For details on how to use this, please see the [README](https://github.com/asmaloney/libE57Format/blob/master/test/README.md) in the test directory of the libE57Format repository.

## Files

### images

These are images used to test writing E57 files containing Image2D.

### self

These E57 files were generated by libE57Format itself and are used for testing reading.

### reference

These E57 files come from the [E57 Example/Test Data](http://www.libe57.org/data.html) site.
